<p>The Doctoral Symposium on Research on Online Databases in History is intended to bring together Ph.D. students within fields of Humanities, Computer Science and Digital Humanities to discuss their research in an international forum. More precisely, the Doctoral Symposium will provide students within:
<ul>
<li>Presenting their research work in a scientific environment;</li>
<li>Receiving feedback and suggestions from peers and experienced faculty;</li>
<li>Gaining an overview of the breadth and depth of data for history;</li>
<li>Obtain insight into directions for research on online databases in history taken by other doctoral candidates;</li>
<li>Discuss concerns about research and methodologies, and other issues;</li>
<li>A Network with peers and future colleagues</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
The Doctoral Symposium is hosted by Leipzig University of Applied Science, Faculty of Informatics and Media (HTWK) as part of the Research project <a href="https://pcp-on-web.htwk-leipzig.de" target="_blank">Early Modern Professorial Career Patterns - Methodological research on online databases of academic history</a>, in cooperation with the European Consortium on <a href="http://dataforhistory.org/" target="_blank">Data for History</a>. A general meeting of the DfH Consortium is part of the workshop and includes the application of the <a href="http://ontologies.dataforhistory.org/" target="_blank">OntoMe - Ontology Management Environment</a>, a platform to design vocabularies using ontologies contributed by the participating Ph.D. students.
